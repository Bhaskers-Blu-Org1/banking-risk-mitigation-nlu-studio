## Work in Progress
# Banking Risk Mitigation using NLU Studio

## Included Components

* [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding): An IBM Cloud service that can analyze text to extract meta-data from content such as concepts, entities, keywords, categories, sentiment, emotion, relations, semantic roles, using natural language understanding.

## Featured Technologies

* [Natural Language Processing](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-understanding): Natural Language Processing is a field that covers computer understanding and manipulation of human language, and itâ€™s ripe with possibilities for newsgathering.
* [Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/learn/cloud/): Accessing computer and information technology resources through the Internet.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
