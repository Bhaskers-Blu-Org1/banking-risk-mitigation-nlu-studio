## Work in Progress
# Banking Risk Mitigation using NLU Studio

## Included Components

* [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding): An IBM Cloud service that can analyze text to extract meta-data from content such as concepts, entities, keywords, categories, sentiment, emotion, relations, semantic roles, using natural language understanding.

## Featured Technologies

* [Natural Language Processing](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-understanding): Natural Language Processing is a field that covers computer understanding and manipulation of human language, and itâ€™s ripe with possibilities for newsgathering.
* [Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/learn/cloud/): Accessing computer and information technology resources through the Internet.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.

## Steps
1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create IBM Cloud service](#2-create-ibm-cloud-service)
3. [Update the NLU service credentials](#3-update-the-NLU-service-credentials)
4. [Configure Manifest file](#4-configure-manifest-file)
5. [Configure .env file](#5-configure-env-file)
6. [Run Application](#6-run-application)

## 1. Clone the repo

Now you're ready to start working with the app. Clone the repo and change to the directory where the sample app is located.
  ```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/banking-risk-mitigation-nlu-studio
cd banking-risk-mitigation-nlu-studio
  ```

  Peruse the files in the *get-started-python* directory to familiarize yourself with the contents.
  
## 2. Create IBM Cloud service

Create the following IBM Cloud service. Select the appropriate region, organization and space:

## 3. Update the NLU service credentials

Open the Watson Natural Language Understanding service in your [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/services) and click on your Natural Language Understanding service.

Once the service is open click the `Service Credentials` menu on the left.
